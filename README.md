# ðŸŽ¹ MIDI Keyboard Chord Trainer

This project helps you **learn chords** by connecting your **MIDI keyboard** and visualizing the keys you play in real-time.

In this new version, I improved the design by **visualizing a realistic MIDI keyboard** on the screen.  
You can now see **which key** and **which chord** you are playing instantly.  
I also worked on **faster chord transitions** to make the training experience smoother and more responsive.
